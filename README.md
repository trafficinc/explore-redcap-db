# Tool to Explore the RedCap Database

This is a small tool to get to know which tables in Redcap are affected by actions via DB inserts and deletes.

Update  `dbconfig.example.php` with database creds, then change filename to `dbconfig.php`, and update the `config.php` file (make sure the directory exists for exports).

First run `php learndb.php get-tables` to update the tables for this tool to use.

1) Before you make a change in Redcap run: $ `php learndb.php before`

2) Do something on the app UI, like fill out and submit a form, ie. create a new project.

3) After you make a change in Redcap run: $ `php learndb.php after`

4) To see what was changed in the DB tables, run: $ `php learndb.php compare`

### Export Data to Files

 `php learndb.php export="new_project_output.txt"`

 This command will run a "compare", and export to the file name specified and to the file path specified in the `config.php` file.

 Or save output to a file: `php learndb.php compare > new_project_output.txt`

Now you will be able to see what database tables were effected! **Note: this works on inserts and deletes, and updates, it expects primary keys in tables, if not present it will take the first column in the table for update(s) output.  Updates show just the row that was updated, not the specific column in the row, but the row can be found by the "PK Row ID" in "Updates Found:". Sometimes the PK Row ID is "0", that means there is no autoincremented value in the first column.

## Example output:
